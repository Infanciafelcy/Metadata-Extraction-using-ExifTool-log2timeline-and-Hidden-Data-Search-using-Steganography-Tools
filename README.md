# Metadata-Extraction-using-ExifTool-log2timeline-and-Hidden-Data-Search-using-Steganography-Tools
## AIM:
To extract metadata, perform timeline analysis, and search for hidden data using forensic tools like ExifTool, log2timeline, and steganography detection tools.

## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1:
Use exiftool to extract metadata from files such as images, documents, and videos.

### Step 2:
Use log2timeline and plaso to create and analyze event timelines from system logs and file metadata.

### Step 3:
Apply steganography detection tools like steghide, zsteg, or binwalk to uncover hidden data in media files.

## PROGRAM:

## Using binwalk â€“ for file analysis
```
sudo apt install binwalk -y
binwalk suspicious.jpg
binwalk /home/kali/Downloads/wallpaper.jpg
```
## RESULT:
Metadata was successfully extracted, timeline analysis was completed, and hidden data was identified using steganography tools.
